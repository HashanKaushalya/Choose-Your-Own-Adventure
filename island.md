## The Adventure Begins on the Island

Adam and Tim decided to take a small boat that Uncle Patrick had kept near the lighthouse. They packed some snacks, water, and a map. With a little push, they set off on their small adventure to the island.

As they rowed closer, they noticed the island was covered with tall trees and rocky cliffs. Birds flew overhead, and the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks made their hearts race with excitement.

When they arrived on the island, they had three choices:

- [Explore the beach](beach.md)
- [Venture into the forest](forest.md)
- [Go to the sea cave](seacave.md)
