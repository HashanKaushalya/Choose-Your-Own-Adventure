Adam and Tim swam steadily through the cool ocean, the island seeming both near and far as they pushed against the current. Determined, they kept going, side by side, the excitement of adventure driving them forward. After what felt like ages, they finally reached the sandy shore, exhausted but triumphant. Collapsing onto the warm sand, they exchanged grins, knowing they had completed the first part of their quest.

Once they caught their breath, the boys stood up and surveyed the island. In the distance, a rocky hill jutted out from the trees, mysterious and inviting. “If there’s treasure here, it’s probably hidden in a cave,” Tim said, pointing to the hill. Adam nodded, excitement bubbling up again as they set off toward the rocks, ready to uncover the secrets of the island.

Adam and Tim, still feeling the thrill of their swim, could hear the distant calls of seagulls circling above, adding to the island’s mysterious atmosphere. The warm sand beneath their feet gave way to pebbles as they neared the base of the rocky hill, their minds racing with possibilities of what they might find hidden within.

When they arrived on the island, they had two choices:

- [Let's prepare the dinner](dinner.md)
- [Go to the sea cave](seacave.md)
