## The Mission Under Water Begins......

Adam and Tim are trained swimmers hence they decided to wear their diving gears and explore the sunk pirate ship
with their masks on, they slipped into the cool water and swam toward the shadow below. As they descended deeper, the outline of a large, sunken ship began to take shape. The wooden hull was covered in algae and coral, but they could still make out the skeleton of the pirate ship that had sunk over a century ago.

Suddenly, something shiny caught Adam’s eye. He pointed excitedly toward the ship’s cabin, where a small chest, covered in barnacles, lay wedged between two beams.

"Do you think that’s… the treasure?" Tim asked, his voice muffled by the water, but his eyes wide with excitement.

They had 2 choices to continue thier adventure:

- [Leave the treaure in the ship](leave.md)
- [Take the treasure with them to look what's the truth?](take.md)
